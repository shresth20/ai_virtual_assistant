# AI VIRTUAL ASSISTANT
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/BcTCFKHCBWg>
#### Description:
Welcome to my CS50 final project presentation! In this video, I'll walk you through the journey of creating an AI virtual assistant using Python. This project was developed as part of the renowned CS50 course at Harvard University, and I'm excited to showcase the results of our hard work.

ü§ñ What is this project all about?
Our AI virtual assistant is designed to simplify tasks and make your life more convenient. From answering questions to performing tasks, this virtual assistant can do it all.

üîß Technologies Used:
Python: We used Python as our primary programming language.
Speech Recognition: We implemented speech recognition to enable voice commands.
AI and Machine Learning: We integrated AI and ML models to enhance the virtual assistant's capabilities.

üìã Key Features:
Use automation python package and libraries.
And also use Open AI for giving result.
Integration with third-party APIs for real-time information.
Customizable and expandable functionalities.

üëç If you find this project interesting or have any questions, please don't hesitate to leave a comment and like the video.

 Thanks for watching!

#### What My software do :
It's AI-based virtual assistant built using Python, featuring OpenAI 'ChatGPT' as its core intelligence. And for music lovers I also add spotify automation who, make's your music experience effortless.This virtual assistant goes beyond answering questions; it combines various functionalities to make your daily tasks easier and more efficient, Now we will explore its key features and capabilities.

#### What Key features it have, How it be executed :
 OpenAI 'chatGPT' Integration :

 The heart of our virtual assistant is ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model by OpenAI.
ChatGPT allows natural language interactions, answering questions, providing information, and engaging in conversations with users.


Spotify Web Automation :

Control your music playback on Spotify without manual intervention.
Our virtual assistant can seamlessly interact with Spotify Web.
It can search for and play songs on demand, making your music experience effortless.
You can request songs, albums, or playlists, and the assistant will locate and play them on Spotify Web


Web Automation :

The assistant can perform various web-related tasks using web automation libraries,
If you want open some other website so only you just have to tell virtual assistant.
Search Any Site on Browser: Conduct web searches on your preferred browser.
Close Current Websites: Close web browser tabs and windows.


Some additional features :

Screenshot Capture: Take screenshots of your screen on command.
Open and Close applications running on your computer.
The virtual assistant is designed to remember and save long results from conversations.
Long and valuable information shared by the assistant is saved for easy access later.


####  These topics are help me to create project and I learned it. 
In my journey of creating an AI-based virtual assistant and enhancing its functionalities, I delved into several Python libraries and APIs. Here are the key learnings and insights gained from my exploration:

Selenium:

Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web interactions.
I learned how to control web browsers programmatically, enabling web automation tasks like form submissions, navigation, and data extraction.


PyAutoGUI:

PyAutoGUI is a library for automating GUI tasks on the desktop.
I discovered how to simulate mouse and keyboard inputs, which allowed me to create features like taking screenshots and closing apps.


Webbrowser:

The webbrowser library simplifies web-related tasks, such as opening and controlling web browsers.
I integrated it to facilitate web searches and general web interaction in my virtual assistant.

OpenAI (GPT):

OpenAI's GPT-3 is a groundbreaking language model.
I harnessed its capabilities to enable natural language conversations, question answering, and text generation within my virtual assistant.

DateTime:

The datetime library is essential for working with dates and times in Python.
I used it to manage timestamps, schedule tasks, and provide time-related information in my virtual assistant.

APIs:

I explored various APIs to connect my virtual assistant to external services and data sources.
APIs allowed me to fetch real-time information, such as music data from Spotify.

pyttsx3:

pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library.
I integrated it to enable my virtual assistant to speak and convey information audibly to the user.

PIL (Python Imaging Library):

PIL provides extensive image processing capabilities.
I utilized it to capture screenshots and manipulate images as needed within the virtual assistant.

Text-to-Speech and Speech Recognition:

I explored both sides of audio interaction.
With text-to-speech (TTS) using pyttsx3, I allowed the assistant to convert text into speech.
With speech recognition, I incorporated the ability for the assistant to understand and act upon voice commands from users.
